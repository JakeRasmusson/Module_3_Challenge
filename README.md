# Employee Payroll Tracker

## Description

The goal of this project was to add additional functionality to the exist payroll tracker.  The enhanced functionality includes creating an array of employees for storing name and salary information.  Then using that array we are able to calulate the average salary of all employees.  Finally we added the ability to choose a random employee.
